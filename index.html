        JDM, which stands for Japanese Domestic Market, refers to vehicles
        manufactured in Japan and intended for sale in the Japanese market. JDM
        car sales have become increasingly popular in recent years, with car
        enthusiasts around the world seeking out unique and high-performance
        Japanese cars that were never officially sold in their home
        countries.<br /><br />
        The JDM car market includes a wide range of vehicles, including sports
        cars, sedans, SUVs, and trucks, from popular brands such as Toyota,
        Honda, Nissan, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. Many of these vehicles are highly
        sought-after for their performance, reliability, and unique styling. JDM
        car sales can take various forms, including private sales between
        individuals, auctions, and imports through specialized dealerships.
        <br /><br />
        Importing JDM cars can be a complex process, as these vehicles often
        need to meet certain safety and emissions regulations before they can be
        legally driven on the roads. Despite the challenges of importing JDM
        cars, the popularity of these vehicles has continued to grow, with many
        enthusiasts willing to go through the process to get their hands on a
        rare and exciting piece of automotive history.
